# James' Portfolio

This is the source code for my [portfolio](https://www.jameskbecker.com/). It uses Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation, and is written in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript.

While some of the implementation details may seem a little overkill for this particular use case, the main goal of this project is to showcase some of my skills in the form of code. By leveraging the power of Next.js and TypeScript, I aimed to create a performant and maintainable codebase that demonstrates my proficiency in these technologies. So feel free to explore the code, and if you have any feedback or questions, don't hesitate to reach out!

## Running Locally
